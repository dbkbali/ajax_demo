  description: "Ajax (also AJAX; /ˈeɪdʒæks/; short for asynchronous JavaScript and XML) \
                 is a set of web development techniques utilizing many web technologies used on \
                 the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, web applications \
                 can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without \
                 interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data \
                 interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension \
                 web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. \
                  Data can be retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not \
                  required (JSON is often used in the AJAJ variant), and the requests do not need to be asynchronous",
